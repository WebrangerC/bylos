# Why am I even doing this website
I was introduced to the contemporary thinkers in the areas of productivity, knowledge management and principled living after I started trying to implement P.A.R.A. using Evernote during the summer of 2021 and switched to [[Obsidian Introduction|Obsidian.md]] during the fall of 2021 as an Evernote replacement. I have some [[98-Websites/Website-BYLOS/Pages/About|history]] with these topics, so P.A.R.A. resonated with me for information storage and retrieval. It did not address task/todo management or [[Knowledge Synthesis]] so I struggled for a few months until the Building a Second Brain Summit in March 2022. [[Inspiration and Resources#^4811d5|August Bradley]] and [[Inspiration and Resources#^b347f7|Nick Milo]] started my recognition that [[Obsidian Introduction|Obsidian.md]] could actually provide bridges between these critical areas. 

As I started on this phase of my journey and realized that much of what I was doing was in flux (but gelling if not setting yet)., I wanted to capture the process of development (for me) and provide an  example of customizing these ideas (for you). 

It is ok to try things that end up not being in the final cut and to even share the efforts in [public](https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/Andy+Matuschak/Work+with+the+garage+door+up) 

I plan on explaining [[Blog_Index|what I'm doing]] or [[01-01 Introduction|have done]], some of [[xMusings Introduction|what I'm thinking]] and [[Inspiration and Resources|the inspiration for my thinking]].  

Please reach out to me with comments and ideas at bruce@bylos.net. I will be setting up a discussion forum somewhere and will provide a link when it is available.
