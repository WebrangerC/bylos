# About **A**ctivities

Activities organize the things we purposefully do and need to address. Activities have 'deliverables' and often a 'delivery date'.  I organize Activities as Projects (with deliverables and delivery dates) or Spheres (of responsibility but looser deliverables/dates). Supporting Projects and Spheres are Tasks.
