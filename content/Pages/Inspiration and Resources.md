# The inspiration for FAKRA
**P.A.R.A – Tiago Forte**  
Tiago coined the idea of [“Building a Second Brain”](https://fortelabs.co/start-here/) based on Project, Areas, Resources and Archives. He bases his work on David Allen’s [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and adds a step up to digital materials. Tiago promotes the best tool for the job and offers  suggestions.

**PPV – August Bradley**  
[August](http://www.augustbradley.com) has a focus on the flow of organization which he tags as a Life Operating System based on [Pillars, Pipelines and Vaults (PPV)](https://www.youtube.com/user/augustbradley). Notion is his tool of choice. ^4811d5

**LyT – Nick Milo**  
Nick promotes using linking as a mechanism to aid knowledge discovery, hence [Linking Your Thinking(LyT)](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com)  Obsidian is his tool of choice. ^b347f7
