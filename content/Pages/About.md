Hello !
I'm Bruce Lerner, a retired systems engineer. 

I have been struggling with managing my life and my work since the 1980’s. I’m sure I was a major part of the problem (oohh shiny) but there was a long list of methods and tools to try.

Pre-2000, for methods/tools, I started using personal organizers/planners from [Day-Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-Timer), then the [Franklin Planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Planner), then Covey (now [FranklinCovey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FranklinCovey)) and  For tools I used planners/organizers offered by the methods companies and various basic software tools: calendars, spreadsheets.  In the 90's I started using [Personal information managers (PIMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_manager): PackRat ([Disappointing Updates To Good Products – see entry 3](https://www.pcworld.com/article/521014/10_disappointing_updates_to_good_products.html)), Commence (from Jensen-Jones) and the [PalmPilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot). In the late '90's I was the member of a team investigating knowledge management for our corporate library. Back to productivity, David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) arrived in the ’00s and I started using Evernote in 2008 with a mixture of data capture and planning. I acquired the Pocket habit in 2012/13. I had all the pieces, but maybe too many pieces. I believe that the current community and tools can provide a consolidating solution.
