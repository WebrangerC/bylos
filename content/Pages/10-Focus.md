I've delved a bit further and reworked my areas of focus (old one [[10-Focus-old|here]]).
You will notice that the selected areas of Focus reveal quite a bit about me. There is nothing that obviously addresses 'children' since mine are all adults. There was a time when they would have commanded a number of entries. This exemplifies that the outline of the system can be shared but you need to give some thought to how you will use it.
