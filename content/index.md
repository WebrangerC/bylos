# Build YOUR <b>L</b>ife Operating System (BYLOS)

BYLOS is the instantiation of my Life Operating System (~~FAKRA~~ [[2023-11-17_Name Change - VACAR|VACAR]]) using Obsidian.md. It is a work-in-progress  describing ~~[[BYLOS/Obsidian/FAKRA/1 Overview/01-01 Introduction|FAKRA]]~~  [[2023-11-17_Name Change - VACAR|VACAR]] ,  [[discussing the concepts]], the tool [[Obsidian Introduction|Obsidian]] and provides an [[+About ~Atlas|example]] of the pairing.

#### Why I am publishing this
I was introduced to the contemporary thinkers in the areas of productivity, knowledge management and principled living after I started trying to implement P.A.R.A. using Evernote during the summer of 2021 and switched to [[Obsidian Introduction|Obsidian.md]] during the fall of 2021 as an Evernote replacement. I say "contemporary" because I have some [[98-Websites/Website-BYLOS/Pages/About|history]] with these topics, so P.A.R.A. resonated with me for information storage and retrieval. It did not address task/todo management or [[Knowledge Synthesis]] so I struggled for a few months until [[Inspiration and Resources|Tiago Forte's]]  conference on [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)  Summit in March 2022. [[Inspiration and Resources|August Bradley]] and [[Inspiration and Resources|Nick Milo]] started my recognition that [[Obsidian Introduction|Obsidian.md]] could actually provide bridges between these critical areas. 

As I started on this phase of my journey and realized that much of what I was doing was in flux (but gelling if not setting yet). I wanted to capture the process of development (for me) and provide an  example of customizing these ideas (for you). 

I decided it is ok to try things that end up not being in the final cut and to even share the efforts in [public](https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/Andy+Matuschak/Work+with+the+garage+door+up) 
I plan on explaining [[BYLOS/Blog/Blog_Index|what I'm doing]] or [[Blog_Index|have done]], some of [[Musings_Introduction|what I'm thinking]] and [[Inspiration and Resources|the inspiration for my thinking]].  

Please reach out to me with comments and ideas at bruce@bylos.net. I will be setting up a discussion forum somewhere and will provide a link when it is available. 

As this is a work in progress, I find that I am adding/changing things sometimes before I capture them here. It makes for a slippery slope but might provide some insight to others (and keep me focused).
