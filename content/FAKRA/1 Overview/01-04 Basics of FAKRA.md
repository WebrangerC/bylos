# Basics of FAKRA
My system uses two primary classes of data:  organizational elements and  informational/data elements. These classes are supported by digital tools that supports linking and tagging along with file storage. 
 
Organizational elements primarily have links to informational/data elements. Informational/data elements consist of text, pictures, audio, video, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. Essentially anything you can store. 

The specific organizational categories I am using are: 
- **Focus** (Business, Growth, Home-Life)
- **Activities** (Projects, Tasks, Spheres (of responsibility)

Knowledge is stored in:
- **Knowledge Garden**
	and blooms as our understanding of information and the world around us matures and grows 

The Informational/data elements are stored in:

* **Repositories**: 
	And I am using a separate vault to store items that are not 'active' but need to be available and to more easily manage synchronizing to lower storage volume devices:
* **Archives**:
	(synchronized on my desktop/laptop but not needed on my phone)

Along with these elements, I have a few support elements:

* **Inbox**  
	a place to hold information that has not yet been categorized and tagged
- **Calendar**
	Helps manage time-based activities
* **Extras** 
	* Templates:   an obsidian specific location to to store . . .  templates
	* Searches:  user-defined Obsidian searches
	* other resources: information about Obsidian, markdown, ... (might belong in a repository)

- **Hard Delete**
	the place I move files and folders I don't want to hold in my .trash that I periodically delete via the computer file manager.
