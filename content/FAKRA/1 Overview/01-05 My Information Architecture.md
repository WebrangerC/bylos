# My Information Architecture
Obsidian uses folders to hold files. My folder/file structure in Obsidian used PARA and PPV as examples (although others may be similar). The top-level is just the Obsidian vault I've called BYLOS, with the top-level folders providing structure for my organizational and data elements. The numbering allows for display organization.

### FAKRA 
The "00" level of folders provide support for FAKRA
[[00-Atlas|00-Atlas]]: contains Indexes and Maps of Content to help navigate our Obsidian Vault
[[00-Calendar|00-Calendar]]: contains date oriented information
[[00-Inbox|00-Inbox]]: holds incoming information which requires additional review, development, organization

Level "10" through "50" are the core of FAKRA
[[10-Focus-old|10-Focus]]: contains a representation of the areas of your life that indicate where you want to or need to spend your time
[[20-Activities|20-Activities]]: contain support for managing our time
[[30-Knowledge Garden|30-Knowledge Garden]]: a place to cultivate and grow your knowledge
[[40-Repository|40-Repository]]: the place to store data,  in-process and complete information
[[50-Archive|50-Archive]]: the place to store completed work or consumed information where the source reference is still needed, or history is useful

Level "90" holds Obsidian support 
[[90-Bins|90-Bins]]
