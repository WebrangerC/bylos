# PARA + PPV + LyT + Experience=> FAKRA (Focus - Activities - Knowledge Garden - Repository - Archive)

Having worked with various systems to address personal and professional growth over 40 years from Daytimer, Franklin and Covey to P.A.R.A. I've used paper, text editors, word processors, spreadsheets, databases and PIMs. I am investigating LyT and PPV. There is nothing "wrong" with any of these systems but they are constrained by the intent of the developers/implementers. 

The title references the three systems that coalesced my thinking. References can be found here [[Inspiration and Resources]]. These ideas combining with my adoption of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) brought me to the thinking captured here. 

Obsidian is a tool that stores data locally but synchronizes using the internet and executes on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones so that it is almost always with me (even when not on-line). Other tools may well be applicable, but my bandwith is satisfied with one.

For a system to work for **YOU** (and for you to use it), **YOU** have to determine what **YOUR** personal motivation are and select or create a compatible system to support your goals.

**My choice is to create a system addressing all four areas, a [[life operating system|Life OS]]:**
1.  **Life-oriented philosophy/principled living** driving motivation  ==> **Focus**
2. **Planning/Productivity** (task management: life, daily, project)  ==> **Activities**
3. **Information/Idea management** (information capture/retrieval: notes, references) ==> **Repositories** and **Archives**
4. **Knowledge management** (knowledge consolidation/discovery/retrieval: using links, tags and mapping) ==> **Knowledge Garden**.

The extent that I apply the four areas will be my personal "[[focused offering]]".
