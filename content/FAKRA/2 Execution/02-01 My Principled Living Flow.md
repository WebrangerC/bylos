**[[Principled Living]]  Flow** 

The overall flow is:
- As we recognize or develop our principles we should capture them as [[+About Focus|Focus areas]] and begin applying our time in alignment with our principles
- We align with our principles by developing goals that advance us toward or directly strengthen our principles.
- To meet our goals we formalize our efforts through [[+About Activities|Projects and Spheres]].
- We define [[+About Focus|Tasks]] to help us manage our Projects and Spheres in practical chunks.
