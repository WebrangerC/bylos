With the addition of "Properties", Obsidian has provided a way to add header information including clickable link that allows for the full set of information types available. This  meaning that the 'hide-able' metadata can replace any information/reference/cross-reference data that you might have left visible (so it could be 'clicked'). This is a game-changer in making notes more readable and useful but will cause a long-term re-edit as notes are accessed. I don't suggest going through all your notes at once to make these changes as the old style works and you have better thing to do (even nothing, if you can.) Subjugate your OCD.
