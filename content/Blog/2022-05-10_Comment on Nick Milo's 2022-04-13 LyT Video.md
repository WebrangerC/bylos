# Comment on Nick Milo's 2022-04-13 LyT Video

Nick released some thinking about the "Knowledge Process" which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkqpL5SfXbc). I'm just starting to catch up with his offerings and find that his use of Obsidian is insightful. He is solidly in the camp of  providing what I express as a "focused offering" and within that offering his ideas are resonating with me, sometimes consistent with and other times informing my developing ideas. 

He also raises the point that "there is a space between stimulus and response" that offers us a chance to be thoughtful rather than reactive. That quote originated with Viktor Frankl, a psychologist and Holocaust survivor :  "**Between** **stimulus** **and** **response** there is a **space**. In that **space** is our power to choose our **response**. In our **response** lies our growth and our freedom." 

This thought from Frankl is to take time to respond in our interactions with people and events rather than just react and Nick suggests that we assimilate information rather than just capture it. Both are useful.
