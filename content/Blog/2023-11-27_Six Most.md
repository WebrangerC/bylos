Another example of [[How Quickly Things Change]]. I started using "Six  Most" on my [[Daily Notes Planning Section_2023-11-05.jpg|DailyNotes Planning section]] as a way to have one place to look to see what I should be working on November 12, 2023. It was a manual bullet list containing  anything I wanted to do but primarily populated with items from my consolidated task list. I realized by November 27, 2023 that adding anything I wanted circumvented any sort of organized plan. I added a checkbox Property "six most" which I add to any Activity that I choose to be working on and have a Dataview table sorted by Rank (importance * urgency) showing the top 6. I display this in my Daily and Weekly Notes to actually keep focus. This also means that I have to be mindful of actually adding  the "six most" property. 

dataview block:
>    TABLE importance * urgency AS "Rank" 
 >   FROM "Activities"
 >   WHERE six-most
 >   SORT importance * urgency desc
 >   LIMIT 6
