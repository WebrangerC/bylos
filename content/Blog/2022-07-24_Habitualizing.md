# Habitualizing  

The more of your life that you can habitualize, the less you need to remember. To make something a habit it must be performed repeatedly on an associated trigger-able basis (time, associated activity, etc.)  x-number of times ( The most recent research I found, [How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.830&rep=rep1&type=pdf)), indicates a median time of 66 repetitions but a range of 18-254 ).  Activities that are periodic but not frequent will obviously take some time and our ability to  consistently perform activities are enhanced by reminders. Therefore I've added some Periodic reminders to support building good [[2022-06-29_Life Operating System (LifeOS)|LifeOS]]  habits. These [[Reminders-Recurring Example|periodic reminders]], strangely enough, pop up periodically on my task list, eventually becoming more annoying than helpful, at which point I remove them, having either habitualized them or realized that they are a waste of time.
