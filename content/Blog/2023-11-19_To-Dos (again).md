# To-Dos (again)
We all have a daily list of things we should do.  I like to keep it in the same place I evaluate the rest of my use of time. I had been trying to manage to-dos using a project perspective  but found this insufficiently nimble as it was generally literally a list.  While migrating my notes from FAKRA to VACAR, I realized that both the effort and project perspectives overlooked this important aspect of daily  life - 'to-dos.'

To begin with, let's characterize/differentiate efforts, projects and to dos.  Nick Milo introduced 'Efforts' in his Ideaverse which can be investigated [here](https://start.linkingyourthinking.com/ideaverse-for-obsidian) 

| Project            | Effort |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| a set of defined tasks                   | loosely defined exertion       |
| task sequence     | often its the exertion not the order       |
| deadlines          | only loosely defined       |
| a defined endpoint | not always sure what the end looks like       |

 Sometimes my to-dos were a list of places I needed to go while I was out. Other times it was something that needed to be done by the end of the month (renew a subscription. Sometimes a calendar reminder was sufficient, other times there needed to be some thought and planning captured. However I always wanted a list of them with me.  I tried to understand how to-dos related to projects and efforts:

| Project            | Effort | To-Do|
| ------------------ | ------ | -----|
| a set of defined tasks   | loosely defined exertion | a single task  |
| task sequence     | often its the exertion not the order | just do it |
| deadlines          | only loosely defined       | loose deadlines, sometimes |
| a defined endpoint | not always sure what the end looks like | a definable enpoint |

So I now have three sub-types of 'Activities': Projects, Efforts and To-Dos.
- Efforts help me convert ideas in knowledge or content
- Project help me manage activities with a number of steps that must be coordinated (tasks)
- To Dos allow me to manage one-off actions
 
 I believe  the technology will support managing to-dos like efforts so I am giving it a try. This is an upgrade (or at least a change) to my previous attempt captured [[BYLOS/Blog/2022-09-22_To Dos|here]].
