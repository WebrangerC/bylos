# Keywords

I realized that keywords are an important way to connect ideas, applying 'random' words at the moment of note creation. However, there is no good way of tracking/reviewing them if they are created as a dataview annotation. My trial solution is to have a tag `#kw/"keyword"` so there is a place in the tags pane where I can see all of my keywords. I can also use dataview to report on them. I've modified my templates and will find out if this pans out.
