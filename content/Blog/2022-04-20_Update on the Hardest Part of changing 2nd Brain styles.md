# Update on the Hardest Part of changing 2nd Brain style
I've been working on migrating my Evernote P.A.R.A files for more than 2 weeks, there are a lot of them. I've migrated all of my "Project" oriented information and feel like it is all retrievable. Prioritizing is next for them. My "Areas" and "Resource" collections are still pretty full. They may need to exist for a while. What I end up needing will be migrated, and what's left might be jetsam. Follow my progress visually, here:  [[PKM & Graph View|PKM & Graph View]]

I've also added a couple of pages to the description of  [[01-02 PARA + PPV + LyT + Experience=> FAKRA|FAKRA]]
