Another gap in posting, a ton of changes in what I'm doing. 
I've continued to try to lasso the long list of "things to do" and tasks and took a look at  [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) and [MetaEdit](https://github.com/chhoumann/MetaEdit) developed by [Christian Houmann](https://bagerbach.com/about/)'which he uses as a base for managing his [projects](https://bagerbach.com/blog/projects-and-goals-obsidian) . This jogged me into thinking more about where projects come from, the difference between to-dos and tasks, spheres of responsibility and interests. Along with this I've been thinking about the relationship between data, information and knowledge. The result is a change to my primary organization providing:

**F**[[+About Focus|ocus Areas]]: the base for [[02-01 My Principled Living Flow|principled living]]
**A**[[+About Activities|ctivities]]: organize the things we do to support our Focus areas
**K**[[+About Knowledge Garden|nowlege Garden]]: where we nurture and mature our processed information
**R**[[+About Repository|epositories]]: where data and information is stored
**A**[[+About Archives|rchives]]: a cul-de-sac for completed projects and processed information 

With some FAKRA support:  [[+About ~Atlas|Atlas]], [[+About ~Calendar|Calendar]], [[+About Inbox|Inbox]] 
some Obsidian.md support: [[+About Bins|Bins]]
and some house cleaning support:  [[+About HARD DELETE|HARD DELETE]]
