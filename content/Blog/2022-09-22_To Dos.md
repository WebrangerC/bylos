# To Dos 

My to-do list is always too long, I want to do everything, the list would be longer if i had an easy way of adding to it.   I can't really address it now. HELP !

What I am planning on doing is to:
- create a [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) to capture to-dos
- use a tag so I can extract all the to-dos with [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- create Dataviews to be able to review my to-dos and maybe make some sense out of them so I can get some off the list

I'll let you know how it goes.
