# Migration to VACAR progress
The migration process which I started on 2023-11-10 is accelerating quickly (actually faster than I'd like).  I decided that the only way to really test Milo's Ideaverse and my changes to FAKRA was to move my Calendar and Daily Notes to my VACAR vault and start using it. So I now have two active vaults. I do some work in FAKRA but each piece I use in VACAR that links or needs a link to notes in FAKRA means I must move the note from FAKRA to VACAR. Overall, this process offers me the opportunity to reassess the data I'd migrated from evernote and remove or archive a lot of it. Declaring cognitive bankruptcy can be a useful mechanism.
