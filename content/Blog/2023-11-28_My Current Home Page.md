Here is one of the changes I made when 'canvas' was released. I changed my list-based homepage: ![[Pre-canvas Hompage.jpg|pre-canvas home page]]to a canvas-based view: ![[+Home Dashboard_2023-11-01.jpg|canvas]] (which I open when the vault opens with the Homepage plugin).  This page is in continuous flux as I move things around, add, remove as I realize what I use and need to find/navigate to. 
With Nick Milo's release of his Ideaverse, I have moved back to a text-based homepage (but keep the visual one as a dashboard):

![[VACAR home page 1.jpg]]
I am warming to the feel of this page with its simple layout and guidance through text. I am sure it will change some and I will provide updates as I learn.
