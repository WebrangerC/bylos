# Name Change - VACAR
I have been questioning my use of the word Focus, which indicated what you should do, and decided to replace it with the word that addresses WHY you are doing - VALUEs. While life can drive us to play on [Maslow's field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs), our better selves should be driving to meet our best expectations of ourselves (and, of course, you set 'best'). This is important because “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”  
― Annie Dillard, The Writing Life 
(I think of it as "the way we spend our time", but Dillard deserves the credit). 

[Nick Milo 's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA)  concept of simplifying the top-level categories of where things are stored is consistent with [Tiago Forte's](https://fortelabs.com/) P.A.R.A. Both sites have become quite 'salesy' but if you head down to resources and hit youtube for Nick or Blog & Videos for Tiago you can get  a sense for the their ideas. Nick tries to fit everything into A.C.E. or Activities-Calendar-Efforts but his focus is on idea relating for content creation vs. P.A.R.A. or Projects-Areas-Resources-Archives with Tiago focused on bringing  projects to completion. Both touch on each other's areas but with a different [[focused offering|focus]] and both touch on integrating their processes into your whole life. Starting with <span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">V</span>alues is aligned with Stephen Covey's  [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People).  I agree with Nick that an "<span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">A</span>tlas" is a place to store navigation information, but not that it should store all information. <span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">C</span>alendar is the place to manage time-oriented information. My  <span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">A</span>ctivity uses both Efforts from Ideaverse and Projects from P.A.R.A. since I need to both land projects and still percolate ideas. Lastly, I store my stuff in a <span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">R</span>epository.  Hence <span style="color:red; font-size:1.2em">VACAR</span>.
