# "Working with the garage door up"
It has been a full couple of weeks in my development of BYLOS.  
Nick Milo released the [LYT 6 Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftzQOkzGCLg), I've been digging into his concepts for [ENCODED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZAprjRutU) & [ACCESS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zWJ-TLghw),  Have I mentionied that I think he's got some valuable ideas and insights? I've also been looking for a good mechanism in Obsidian to address the task management part of Productivity and am working with Christian Houmann's Obsidian plugins, QuickAdd and MetaEdit [described here](https://bagerbach.com/blog/projects-and-goals-obsidian).  I stumbled on [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) and ["Working with the garage door up"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)through these [notes](https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/) in Obsidian Publish. And I'm now publishing this site directly from Obsidian (as of 2022-06-01). 

I've decided to put an on-going in-process example of my Obsidian Vault on GitLab and start a forum to allow for feedback (as the static site doesn't seem to offer that, or I haven't found it yet) - as soon as I figure out the details.

Who knows, I could be approaching my Waterloo (I know you are thinking [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj_9CiNkkn4)) or an [Apollo 11 moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL9IRKoFv_4).  Perhaps you can help me determine which it will be.
