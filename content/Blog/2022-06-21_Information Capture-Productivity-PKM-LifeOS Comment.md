I've been drawn in to the communities around these topics over the last few months and I'm finding there are so many use cases and so many individual use hurdles that I'm not surprised by any comment (supportive, disparaging or even inflammatory) about any method or tool .  I've been trying to get my mind and life under some form of management for decades using paper thru self architected DBs. This space is like dieting: most diets work for some people, no diet works for everyone. Single tools might be better as an out-of-the-box solutions for a subset of the four large use cases but don't see any single tool addressing all four without some significant tailoring. Using multiple tools has always been a speed bump for me, although there hasn't been a better answer (for me). I enjoy tailoring my tools. Obsidian is the best software for this (for me) since the 1990's.
