I was reviewing my path in getting to and using Obsidian:
- implementing PARA in Evernote (2020-06)
- migrating my data from Evernote to Obsidian(2021-05)
- migrating my data to a PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) organization (2021-10)
- recognizing that PARA addressed organizing activities and associated data/information but did not help focus those activities in directions important to me leading to my introducing 'focus'. (2022-03), leading to:
- FASIVA (Focus Area, Activities <Projects, Tasks>, Spheres, Interests, Vaults, Archive)  (2022-03)
- FAVA (Focus Area, Activities <Projects, Tasks>, Vaults, Archive) (2022-04), when I recognized that Spheres and Interests were only additional ways of generating tasks (now Projects, Efforts or To Dos). 
- FAKRA (Focus Areas, Activities <Projects, Tasks>, [[Knowledge]], Respository, Archive) (2023-03-31) because P<span style="color: red">K</span>M and Vaults are just data <span style="color: red">R</span>epositories.
- VACAR (Values, Atlas, Calendar, Activities <Projects, Efforts, ToDos>, Repository) (2023-11-15) because <span style="color: red">V</span>alues says what I mean and I couldn't decide what to do with knowledge (yeah, I know it sounds wrong).

You'll notice that I have that acronym/initialism disease common to engineers, pkm'ers, productivity gurus.
