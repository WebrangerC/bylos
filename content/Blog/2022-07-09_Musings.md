# Musings 
I find that I'm having trouble keeping to a blog schedule because I always seem to be in the middle of changing something which leads me to think that I will need to retract anything I write in a few days. It's a disincentive. So, I am going to allow myself to discuss what changed, what I'm thinking, why and how it might change (or change again) in the section I unwittingly created without knowing why - "Musings". Or I may not use it at all, as just knowing that I have it will set me [free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXnWRw7Gff4)
