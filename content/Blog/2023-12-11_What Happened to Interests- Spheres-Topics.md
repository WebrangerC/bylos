If you find Interests, Spheres and Topics in a previous version of my BYLOS (FASIVA), you'll notice they are gone. Spheres (of influence) were my take on PARA's Areas. Interests and Topics were used to organize items that I didn't have any responsibility for. Spheres have been subsumed by Efforts as they are ongoing with limited completion criteria. Interests and Topics are now captured in MOCs or Indexes as they are more informational than activity. Cleanup on aisle 5.
