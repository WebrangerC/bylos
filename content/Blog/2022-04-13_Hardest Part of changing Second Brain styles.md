# Hardest Part of changing Second Brain styles?

Moving myself from a P.A.R.A. orientation to my FAVA style is taking way more time than I like. However, since I never did any clean-up when I moved from Evernote to Obsidian, there was a lot of detritus. Hopefully while re-classifying and whittling down the entries, I am also freeing up some of my first brain. 

One thing I like about the process is the organization template I'm using. It jogs me to think about how I will recover and discover the information. This template goes at the bottom of all my markdown files.

You'll notice some special characters in the above entries which will be explained later. Adding this template to the files saved as P.A.R.A. is cementing my belief that storing in folders/retrieving with [[links]] and discovery with #tags is better than what I had been doing.
