# Navigation Convention for Focus Areas

As I've been working on a process to navigate my Activities, I've decided to experiment with using Dashboards as the consolidating "index" for Focus Areas. The dashboard will provide a table of associated Goals and a table of associated Projects along with a list of associated [[+About MOCs|MOCs]] and other tbd associated information. This is a divergence from using MOCs everywhere as indexes - I'll still be using MOCs for Information, Knowledge and within Activities.
