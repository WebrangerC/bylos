Since my December post, I've switched my static site generator to Quartz which has allowed me to apply a "Let's Encrypt" certificate and also simplified my workflow. This will hopefully decrease the friction between my learning and my posting. 

The biggest change, as can be seen from the Intro is that my underlying structure has changed. A gap between what I am doing and the terminology I've used led me to [[2023-11-17_Name Change - VACAR|VACAR]]. A deeper dive into [[Inspiration and Resources|Nick MIlo's]] Linking Your Thinking/Ideaverse and [[Inspiration and Resources|Tiago Forte's]] Building a Second Brain and P.A.R.A. has modified some of my processes. The philosophy underlying my [[Life Operating System]] is unchanged.

It will take me some time to fix terminology and links on the site while retaining the history of my process so you can see how I got here. In a few weeks I'll ask you to let me know when you find thing that I've missed. Thanks for your patience.
