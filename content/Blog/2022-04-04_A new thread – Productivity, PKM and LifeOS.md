I have spent way too much of my life trying ‘[to get it together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOoeoiO-3C0)‘. The last few months have brought together some philosophy and technology that have me thinking that progress may be made. Here I present some investigation, some thinking and maybe some support for others on this journey. I hadn’t planned it but it appears there may be some music thrown in. Feel free to ignore it as it wasn’t ‘[part of the plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTtSyCxHyW0)‘. Maybe someday I’ll understand.

The full thinking on this topic starts [[01-01 Introduction|here]] with a little background and some resources. Currently I have a bunch of notes and I am putting in the effort to migrate many years of information gathering into this new format, discovering as I go along. This thread will supplement the formatted description of the method and tool use.

As a teaser here is a picture of the growing discovery.
