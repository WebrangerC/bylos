On June 30, I posted about changing my To-do area to display: 
![[DO-Today Query_2022-07-01.png]]
Over the last week I've expanded the quick-link area, added the Week Goals, which is copied from my Weekly Note on Saturday evening/Sunday while I'm doing wrap-up and planning. I found that the Weekly Goals were being overrun by the "Today's Plan" and I was only looking at the goals on wrap-up/plan day. The Tasks are the same query as shown on 2022-06-30 post. Daily's, Blog and Create This Week are shown below. 

I am finding that I can more easily get to what I need, which decreases my effort to get things done quickly. This is an area I expect will change depending on what I'm working on and will be heavily customized by anyone trying BYLOS.
